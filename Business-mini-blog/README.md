Card structure: Includes a header for the blog title, an image, a short excerpt, and a footer for additional details like the author’s name and publication date.

Challenges Faced
This project was completed as part of a DEV website front-end challenge. Some of the challenges I encountered and solved include:

Customizing Bootstrap: It was tricky to balance Bootstrap’s pre-built classes with custom CSS for a unique look.
Making the card responsive: Ensuring that the card layout works seamlessly across different device sizes.
Managing margins and paddings: Getting the spacing right around elements, especially when dealing with Bootstrap's default margins and paddings
